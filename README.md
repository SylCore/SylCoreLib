## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone or Download
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SylCore/SylCore-WoTLK.git
```


### 2. SylCoreLib Framework Setup
Place `SylCoreLib` inside your `lua_scripts` folder.


### 3. VSCode Snippets Setup (Optional but Recommended)
**NOTE: You must install the extension called **Lua** by **sumneko**.**
[Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)

Open **Visual Studio Code**, go to the top-left and hover over "**File**", then hover over "**Preferences**", and click on "**Configure Snippets**".
Now you should be able to see a list open at the center of your screen, find the one called "**lua.json**", then click on it.

Inside `SylCoreLib`, you should see a file called snippets.json, open it and copy everything inside it (Ctrl + A select all), then go back into your "**lua.json**", and paste it in.


### 4. VSCode IntelliSense Setup (Optional but Recommended)
**NOTE: You must install the extension called **Lua** by **sumneko**.**
[Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sumneko.lua)

Place the `SylCore-Eluna-IntelliSense` folder somewhere on your PC.
I would suggest putting it in your Documents folder, but it doesn't matter where you place it; we want to ensure it's not in a location where we might accidentally delete it.

Open **Visual Studio Code**, next go to the top left of **Visual Studio Code**, hover your mouse over "**File**", and go down until you see "**Preferences**", hover your mouse over it and then click on "**Settings**"

Now go up to the top-right, you should see an icon of a document, click on it, and it should open **settings.json**

You will need to add a few things here for the IntelliSense to work. Below are the things you would need to add.

NOTE: Where you see the path, you will need to replace that to point to the correct location of the ElunaAPI.d.lua file.
This file is located inside `SylCore-Eluna-IntelliSense` folder.

```plaintext
    "Lua.workspace.library": [
        "G:\\Absolut\\Path\\To\\Your\\SylCore-Eluna-IntelliSense\\File\\Typings\\SylCore-ElunaAPI.d.lua"
    ],
    "Lua.diagnostics.libraryFiles": "Enable",
    "Lua.completion.callSnippet": "Replace",

```

After that, hit "save" (Ctrl + S) and restart your Visual Studio Code. Now open a Lua file and start writing "Register", and you should see all the "Register" functions. if you see those, it means it worked, congrats!
